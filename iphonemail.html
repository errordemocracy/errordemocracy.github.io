    <h2>Subject:&nbsp;<strong>Appeal to take immediate action against the undemocratic restriction on&nbsp;clothing signifying religion in the State of Karnataka</strong></h2>
    <p>We would like to draw your unfiltered attention to the current accession of intolerance while making women the prime target of hate-mongering and violation of constitutional rights under the garb of uniformity. This also highlights the systemic marginalization of minorities inculcating and normalizing injustice against them. Recent restrictions on donning a hijab in an educational institute followed by others has created tremendous fear of the violation of the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Religion. It has given rise to the suppression of religious symbols used by the Muslim community.</p>

    <p>'Violation Of Human Rights': NHRC Notice To Karnataka Govt. Over Udupi Hijab Row (timesnownews.com)</p>
    <p>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notice to the Karnataka government in connection with eight girl students being banned from entering a government college in Udupi, for wearing a hijab. "Facts of the case are disturbing. The allegations made in the complaint are serious in nature involving 'Right to Education. The case, therefore, involves the grave violation of human rights of the victim students," the notice read. The notice has been sent to the District Magistrate, Udupi, Principal Secretary of the Department of Higher Education, calling for their report in four weeks. All eight girls have been marked absent from 31 December, and have not been able to attend their classes due to wearing hijab.</p>
    <p>Our demands:</p>
    <p>1) Protect the Staff and students' expression of their religion in educational institutes and work premises.</p>
    <p>2) Penalize extremists trying to target and harm students from marginalized and/or minority communities</p>
    <p>3) Hold gender sensitization workshops in schools for both students and staff members</p>
    <p>4) Make gender sensitization workshops a mandatory part of the curriculum that teaches boys about consent and boundaries - the goal is to ensure boys do not grow up to be men who feel entitled to dictate what women should wear</p>
    <p>5) Hold diversity sensitization workshops for police to ensure they know how to handle cases involving people from marginalized and minority communities, and do not feel entitled to dictate how people from these communities should "behave".</p>
    <p>People from marginalized communities in India are constantly asked to 'prove' their loyalty and judged on whether they 'deserve' to be called an Indian citizen or not. It is high time we fight back against these forms of religious intolerance and oppose the violence that is being inflicted upon these communities simply because of their social identity.</p>
